Case Study Brief

Objective: Build a backend service that automates the initial screening of a job application. The service will receive a candidate's CV and a project report, evaluate them against a specific job description and a case study brief, and produce a structured, AI-generated evaluation report.

Core Logic & Data Flow:
- Candidate-Provided Inputs: Candidate CV (PDF), Project Report (PDF)
- System-Internal Documents: Job Description, Case Study Brief, Scoring Rubric

Deliverables:
1. Backend Service (API endpoints):
   - POST /upload: Accepts CV and Project Report, returns file IDs.
   - POST /evaluate: Triggers asynchronous evaluation, returns job ID.
   - GET /result/{id}: Retrieves evaluation status and result.
2. Evaluation Pipeline:
   - RAG for context retrieval.
   - LLM chaining for CV evaluation, project report evaluation, and final summary.
   - Handle long-running processes asynchronously.
   - Implement error handling and control LLM randomness.
3. Standardized Evaluation Parameters:
   - CV Evaluation: Technical Skills, Experience Level, Achievements, Cultural Fit.
   - Project Deliverable Evaluation: Correctness, Code Quality, Resilience, Documentation, Creativity.
